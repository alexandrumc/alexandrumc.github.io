## [](#header-2)Experience and Projects
  - **Online shop**
> I implemented a simple online shop in Java using some design patterns. The customers have all the functions that a real online shop provides, plus the option to get a suggestion about a product that they might like. It is possible to add new products to the shop or edit/remove the existing ones.

  - **Image Detection**
>Using Matlab, I developed a program that could learn from a series of input photos to decide whether a new given image has the same pattern or not. I used RGB and HSV histograms.

  - **Spanning-Tree-Protocol**
>A simplified version of Spanning Tree Protocol implemented in C. For a given number of switches identified by their MAC addresses and a set of rules, the program finds the rood-bridge switch and the root-ports, designated-ports and blocked-ports for all the other switches. After that, the program responds to some commands, like showing the minimum path between two switches or regenerating the STP if a switch is removed.

  - **Google Page Ranking**
>I implemented the simplified version of the Google Page Ranking algorithm using Matlab. The web pages and the links between them were thought as a graph.

  - **2048 game**
>2048-game implementation (written in C) with all the basic functionalities plus an automove function which chooses and makes for your the best move that can be done. [Link to the project repository](https://github.com/alexandrumc/2048-game)
