##  [](#header-2)Research Interests
*   Operating Systems, Compilers, Programming Languages

## [](#header-2) Conferences and Publications
  - **Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, _"SPLASH Conference"_.**
    - I have been awarded a travel grant that fully supported my attendance to the workshop and I participated in mentoring sessions on how to prepare for and thrive in graduate school and in a
research career, focusing both on cutting-edge research topics and practical advice.

  - **Paper published at CAV 2019, _"Communication-Closed Asynchronous Protocols"_.**
    - I am the co-author of a paper that was accepted at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) 2019. In this paper, we proposed a method that reduces the verification of asynchronous fault-tolerant protocols to the verification of round-based synchronous ones. The paper can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_20).

  - **Talk at DConf 2019 London, _"D for a @safer Linux Kernel_".**
    - I gave my very first talk at DConf 2019. The presentation was mainly based on the work that I was doing for my bachelor’s thesis, where I used the D programming language to strengthen the security of Linux kernel modules. The talk can be found [here](https://dconf.org/2019/talks/militaru.html).

## [](#header-2)Experience
  - **Research Scholarship, _The D Language Foundation_, Bucharest, Romania.**
    - November 2019 - Present
    - Working on various aspects of the D Programming Language as part of my MSc thesis.

  - **Compiler Developer Intern, _NXP Semiconductors_, Bucharest, Romania.**
    - July 2019 - October 2019
    - Developing both high-level and low-level optimization techniques.
    - Currently implementing a software pipelining technique to optimize loops.

  - **Research Intern, _French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA)_, École normale supérieur, Paris, France.**
    - June 2018 - September 2018
    - Implemented a code translation tool (basically, an extended parser) that, given a communication-closed asynchronous protocol, soundly computes its round-based synchronous counterpart. (Python)
    - Got involved in the whole research process: from reading useful papers and understanding complex algorithms to conceiving advanced theoretical models and implementing them.
    - The project repository and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/alexandrumc/async-to-sync-translation).

  - **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, _Introduction to Operating Systems_, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science.**
    - October 2017 - Present
    - Linux system fundamentals course.
    - Teaching lab sessions and preparing lab materials.

  - **QA Automation Intern, _ING Romania_.**
    - July 2017 - October 2017
    - Worked with Spring Framework, Maven, Selenium WebDriver and Docker.
    - In the beginning, I had to test their internet banking solution using Cucumber tests. Then, I automated this whole process by creating a Java application that was able to compare screenshots taken by itself before and after completing a given action.
    - This process is currently used in the organization for testing different functionalities.

##  [](#header-2)Hobbies
*   I like very much to travel. My favorite city so far is Paris.
*   I have a great passion for literature, cinema, and painting. One of my favorite painters is Caspar David Friedrich, while my favorite writer is Philip Roth. I really enjoy the French New Wave movies.
*   Some years ago I wrote reviews of books and movies for a cultural website. You can found them [here]((https://filme-carti.ro/author/alexandru/)). (they are written in Romanian)
